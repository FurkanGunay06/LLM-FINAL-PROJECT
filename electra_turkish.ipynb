Mustafa ile hocası ve yakın danışmanı Şeyhülislam Feyzullah Efendi aleyhine gelişen büyük bir ayaklanmadır. Sultan II. Mustafa'nın Erzurum'dan getirterek şeyhülislamlığa yükselttiği hocası Feyzullah Efendi, ayaklanmanın sebebi olduğu için olay, Feyzullah Efendi'nin ismiyle de anılmaya başladı. Seyyid Feyzullah Efendi ikinci defa getirildiği şeyhülislâmlık görevinde devlet işlerine müdahale etmesi, ayaklanmanın ortaya çıkmasının ana sebebidir. Feyzullah Efendi'nin devlet işlerine karışarak terfi, tayin ve azil işlerinde aldırtdığı kararlar nedeniyle saray çevresi, asker ve ulemada rahatsızlık oluşturmaya başlamıştır. Bunun yanı sıra II. Mustafa'nın Edirne'de devlet işleriyle ilgilenmeyip avcılık ile uğraşarak devlet idaresinden uzak kalması, uzun süredir yaşanan ekonomik kriz ile devletin başkentinin Edirne'ye taşınacağı iddiaları da İstanbul halkının isyana katılma nedenlerini oluşturmuştur. 17 Temmuz 1703 tarihinde Şeyhülislam Feyzullah Efendi'nin etkinliğinden rahatsız olan bazı devlet erkanının yönlendirmesiyle gecikmiş ulufeleri bahane eden cebeciler, ayaklanma başlattı. Kısa süre sonra Feyzullah Efendi Vakası; yeniçerilerin, medrese talebelerinin ve İstanbul halkının katılımıyla büyük bir isyana dönüştü. İstanbul'da denetimi ele geçiren isyancılar, sadrazamlığa Kavanoz Ahmed Paşa'yı, şeyhülislamlığa da İmam Mehmed Efendi'yi getirdiler. Bir süre sonra isyancılar isteklerini bildirmek üzere Edirne'ye bir heyet gönderdiler. Ancak isyancıların isteklerinin bildirildiği heyet, Feyzullah Efendi'nin emriyle Havsa civarında tutuklandı. II. Mustafa, isyancıları yumuşatmak amacıyla 27 Temmuz 1703 tarihinde Feyzullah Efendi'yi şeyhülislamlık görevinden aldı. Ancak isyancılar, asker ve halktan oluşan yaklaşık 60.000 kişilik bir kuvvetle ağustos ayı başlarında Edirne'ye harekete geçti. Bu ihtilal ordusu Silivri'ye geldiklerinde II. Mustafa'nın tahttan indirilip öz kardeşi Ahmed'in tahta geçirilmesi için bir karar ve fetva aldılar. İhtilal kuvvetleri engellenemedi ve 20 Ağustos'ta ihtilal kuvveti Edirne'ye ulaştı. 22 Ağustos'ta II. Mustafa tahttan çekilerek yerini öz kardeşi III. Ahmet'e bıraktı. Yeni padişahın onayı alan asiler 3 Eylül'de ağır işkence yaptıkları Feyzullah Efendi'yi öldürdüler. 4 Eylül 1703'de Sultan III. Ahmet İstanbul'a hareket etti. Böylece Edirne'nin fiilen Osmanlı devletine başkentlik etmesinin ikinci dönemi kapanmış oldu. 14 Eylül'de İstanbul'a ulaşan III. Ahmet giderek daha şiddetli ve sert tedbirler alarak devlet idaresini isyancıların elinden kurtarmaya başladı. Ancak 1704'ün ilk aylarında Padişah III. Ahmet egemen olabildi.\"\"\"\n","\n","question = \"Seyyid Feyzullah Efendi ikinci defa getirildiği şeyhülislâmlık görevinde devlet işlerine müdahale etmesi, neyin ana sebebidir?\"\n","\n","# Soruyu ve
